# My Wife's Blog

This is a simple Electron app with the front-end code written in Elm 0.18 that
allows my wife to manage her blog. I wrote her blog with MetalSmith, though I
didn't take into account that although I was quite comfortable editing in
Markdown to create posts, she was not. This project is my attempt to correct
the error of my ways.

## Warning: Hard-code ahead

In order to get this done a bit faster, there are some things that are
"hard-coded" for my wife's blog such as CSS and the structure of the posts,
etc. If you use this, you will need to adjust accordingly for your needs. This
is not a general purpose blogging app.
